# Instances of the Research Article "Optimal assignment of shipments to milk-runs for just-in-time part supply under uncertain due dates"

This repository includes 70 instances, which where used in the computational study of the research article "Optimal assignment of shipments to milk-runs for just-in-time part supply under uncertain due dates" by Julian Baals, Simon Emde, and Ola Jabali.

The folders `shipments_120` and `shipments_120_2` include the instances with 120 shipments. The folder `shipments_400` includes the instances with 400 shipments.

The `.json`-files are structured as follows

- an array called `suppliers`, which includes `supplier`-objects with the attributes
    - an `id` as identifier for the supplier
    - an array `shipments`, which includes the information about the shipments. The `shipment`-objects have the following structure
        - an `id` as identifier for the shipment
        - a `capDemand` corresponding to the shipment's capacity demand
        - an array `dueDate` for the due date of the shipment in each scenario
        - an earliness cost per time unit `earlinessCpTU`
        - a tardiness cost per time unit `tardinessCpTU`
        - a `reschedulingCosts` correspnding to the rescheduling cost of the shipment (independent from the scenario)
    - an array `timeWindows` (not used in the paper)
    - an earliness cost per time unit `earlinessCpTU` (not used in the paper)
    - a tardiness cost per time unit `tardinessCpTU` (not used in the paper)
- an array called `travelTimes`, which includes travel times between the suppliers (only used for instance generation, not in the model solved in the paper)
- an array called `probabilities`, which includes the probability of each scenario
- an array called `routeSets`, which includes an array for each set of `routes. routeSets[0]` corresponds to the routes that are used in the CRS-instances, `routes. routeSets[1]` to the RRS-instances, and `routes. routeSets[2]` to the MRS-instances. Note that the folder `shipments_120_2` only includes CRS- and RRS-instances. Only the RRS-instances were used in the paper. Instance `Shipment120-RRS-10` in the paper coresponds to `instances_shipments_120_2_0_instance.json`, `Shipment120-RRS-11` to `instances_shipments_120_2_1_instance.json` and so on. A route is described by a tuple with
    - `item1` points to the time window in the file's top level attribute `timeWindows`, and
    - `item2` points to the supplier's id, (i.e., `suppliers.id`).
- an array called `timeWindows`, which includes the `start` and `end` of each time window.
